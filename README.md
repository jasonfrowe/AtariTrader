## 🚀 Mission Briefing

*Attention, Commander!*

The galaxy is in peril. The **Evil Empire** has scattered the **five ancient Relics of Power** across the cosmos. These artifacts are the key to ultimate power—and if they remain in enemy hands, the universe is doomed.

You are the pilot of the **M-78 Starfighter**, the most advanced ship in the fleet. Your orders are simple: warp to each sector, eliminate the enemy blockade, and retrieve the Relic required to upgrade your ship for the final confrontation.

But be warned: The **asteroid fields** are treacherous, and the **Empire's Guardians** are waiting.

## 💡 Commander's Tips

1.  **Master Momentum**: You drifted? You died. Learn to tap 'Up' gently to correct your course.
2.  **Don't Panic**: If surrounded, use your thrust to escape the kill zone. Standing still makes you a sitting duck.
3.  **Asteroid Awareness**: Asteroids typically travel "downwind" - keep moving to find safe pockets of space.
4.  **The Boss**: The final guardian has massive shields. You'll need all your upgrades to take it down!
